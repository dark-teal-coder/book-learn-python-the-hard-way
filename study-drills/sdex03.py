# Study Drills 03

# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# 2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6?
# Start python3.6 this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
# 4. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.

# Print out the text inside double quotation. 
# By default, print() ends the printing by \n. 
# print() normally moves the cursor to the next line after printing.
print("I will now count my chickens:") 
# Print "Hens" and the calculation result (i.e. 30.0) after a space.
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) 
# Print "Roosters" and the calculation result (i.e. 97) after a space.
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4) 
# Print out the text inside double quotation. 
print("Now I will count the eggs:") 
# Print out the calculation result (i.e. 6.75). 
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) 
# Print out the text inside double quotation. 
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")
# Python evaluates the expression to a Boolean value (i.e. False). 
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7) 
# Print the text and the calculation result (i.e. 5) after a space.
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2) 
# Print the text and the calculation result (i.e. -2) after a space.

# Print out the text inside double quotation.
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")  
# Print out the text inside double quotation. 
print("How about some more.") 
# Python evaluates the expression to a Boolean value (i.e. True). 
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) 
# Python evaluates the expression to a Boolean value (i.e. True). 
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2) 
# Python evaluates the expression to a Boolean value (i.e. False). 
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
