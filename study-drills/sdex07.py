# Study Drills 07

# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
# 3. From now on, when you make mistakes, 
# write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
# 4. When you go to the next exercise, 
# look at the last mistakes you made and try not to make them in this new one.
# 5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. 
# Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, 
# but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.

# Print the string inside the double quotations. 
print("Mary had a little lamb.")
# Take the string 'snow' and place it at {}. Print it. 
print("Its fleece was white as {}.".format('snow'))
# # Take the string 'snow' and place it at {0:s}. Print it. 
# print("Its fleece was white as {0:s}.".format('snow'))
# Print the string inside the double quotations. 
print("And everywhere that Mary went.")
# Repeatedly combine the dot string 10 times and print the string repeatation. 
print("." * 10) 

# Assign the string "C" to the variable end1. 
end1 = "C"
# Assign the string "h" to the variable end2.

# Assign the string "e" to the variable end3. 
end3 = "e"
# Assign the string "e" to the variable end4. 
end4 = "e"
# Assign the string "s" to the variable end5.

end12 = "r"

# Print the string concatenation end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6.
# End the print statement with a space. 
# Print the string concatenation end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12. 
print(end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end=' ')
print(end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)

# NOTES:
# Python 2: 
# print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
# print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
# Removing the comma will print "Burger" on the next line.
