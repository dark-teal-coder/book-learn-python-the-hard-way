# Study Drills 21

# 1. If you aren't really sure what return does, 
# try writing a few of your own functions and have them return some values. 
# You can return anything that you can put to the right of an =.
# 2. At the end of the script is a puzzle. 
# I'm taking the return value of one function and using it as the argument of another function. 
# I'm doing this in a chain so that I'm kind of creating a formula using the functions. 
# It looks really weird, but if you run the script, you can see the results.
# What you should do is try to figure out the normal formula that would recreate this same set of operations.
# 3. Once you have the formula worked out for the puzzle, 
# get in there and see what happens when you modify the parts of the functions. 
# Try to change it on purpose to make another value.
# 4. Do the inverse. Write a simple formula and use the functions in the same way to calculate it.
