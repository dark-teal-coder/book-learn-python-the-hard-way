Let's do some math with just functions!
ADDING 30 + 5
SUBTRACTING 78 - 4
MULTIPLYING 90 * 2
DIVIDING 100 / 2
Age: 35, Height: 74, Weight: 180, IQ: 50.0
Here is a puzzle.
DIVIDING 50.0 / 2
MULTIPLYING 180 * 25.0
SUBTRACTING 74 - 4500.0
ADDING 35 + -4426.0
That becomes:  -4391.0 Can you do it by hand?
