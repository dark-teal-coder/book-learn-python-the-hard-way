# Description 
This repository contains the code exercises written by Zed Shaw in his book *"Learn Python The Hard Way"*. Zed asks the reader to manually type the exact lines of code as he wrote in each Exercise (unit of the book), save them as a single `.py` file, use PowerShell to run the file and examine the output. There is also a Study Drills exercise at the end of each unit. For those where these exercises are missing, a `print()` statement with a message to inform the user of this repository has been added in the script file. PowerShell screen outputs were saved in `.txt` file format under the directory/folder "ps-outputs" for reference. 

There are 52 exercises/units in this book but the current repository does not have 52 corresponding `.py` files. It will be added later. 

*Remarks: not sure where `writefile.py` comes from*
